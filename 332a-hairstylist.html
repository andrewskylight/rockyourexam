                            <p>It's two weeks before the exam.</p>
                            <p>Every week 'The book' throws new terms at you.</p>
                            <p>Carbuncle … Melanin … Sebaceous Glands … Bonds in hair. It can get <strong>overwhelming</strong>.</p>
                            <p>And as you study, hour after hour after hour again, it's easy to wonder if you're the only one who can't fit it all in your head.</p>
                            <p>Hi, I'm Pamela Jackson. I had been working as a hairstylist for 15 years. Over the past four years as a hairstylist tutor, I've spent countless hours observing students struggling through Hairstylist theory.</p>
                            <p>It starts very early and then gets worse down the road. I totally understand how overwhelming it can be when the course is shotgunning new concepts at you every day. <strong>The material moved four steps forward, while you're still looking two steps back.</strong></p>
                            <p>And the worst part? Everybody else in the room had gone through it. Everyone except you.</p>

                            <p>Now, what are you supposed to do? <strong>Well, of course, what all of us do, is to study more.</strong> "I'll just read it on the bus." "I'll stay later!" "I'll repeat it like a prayer." Whatever it takes, because I'm committed to acing this test - and if not acing, at least passing.</p>
                            <p>But with every passing day, you start to realize more and more, "Hey, there is a big problem. I'm in the middle of the book, behind where I am supposed to be, and I can't even remember what was in the beginning. And the inevitable date of the exam is coming up, <strong>and I don't know what to do."</strong></p>
                            <p>I saw students going through this over and over and over again. And I understand it, if you don't have a strategy to make the material feel smaller, then it does become huge and overwhelming. Over the years of teaching students, I could see how the course is built up from a series of patterns that are being repeated again and again. I asked myself, what is that I do what they don't?</p>
                            <p>It turned out - <strong>we do things in a totally different way.</strong></p>
                            <p>What a typical hair stylist student tries to do is to absorb everything in the book with no sense of priority or structure. They get lost in the ocean of terms and suffocate from the lack of structure. They can't compress and patternize information in such a way that makes it manageable and available on demand. All of this smells bad, it smells really bad.</p>

                            <p>Your busy, so am I. Your time is valuable so is mine. If you had a crystal ball and could see what questions come up on your exam, you'd just figure those out. Unfortunately, you don't have a crystal ball (I don't either btw, otherwise we'd be hanging out on Wall St making billions).</p>
                            <p>If you think the exam is about your ability to cut someone's hair, wrong perspective. Look at the sample questions. The exam is about something totally different. So ..</p>
                            <p>To make sure you pass, I had prepared a study guide that:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Categorizes and organizes material in easy to consume chunks</li>
                                <li>Focuses on the important, and excludes what is not</li>
                                <li>Provides human friendly 'easily memorize this' strategies</li>
                                <li>Makes you an expert in multiple choice format</li>
                                <li>Drills the information to the core level, so that … even if someone wakes you up in the middle of the night … and asks … you go 'boom' … and nail that answer!</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You know, you may have 2, 4 or 6 weeks for your exam - whatever the time is, I can help you master the material, get the grade you deserve, and allow you to show your parents, friends, family, and most of all <strong>yourself</strong> - that you are here for a reason; and you'll emerge victorious.</p>
                            <p>How do I know this? The results of my students speak for themselves.</p>
